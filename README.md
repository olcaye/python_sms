Python Student Management System

I developed this application for Programming Language Design Course on the university. 
Im aware of that the code quality and some oop principles on some points have been messed up.  
Anyway, this is my first python program and my time was limited. So dont be so hard on me :)


In order to start the application, Execute the program from main.py file. You will see the a menu in the terminal like this;

- Add a new student
- Find the student
- Show all students
- Show all students by specific age range
- Edit Student Information
- Delete a Student
- Fetch Students from database.json
- Terminate the program


dataProcess.my contains the functions that handle create,update,read and delete processes on students.json file.

search.py is for searching the students. In order to find a student by a criteria, execute program from search.py.

Whenever you want, you can use the "Fetch Students from database.json" option to populate to students.json.
